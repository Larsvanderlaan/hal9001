\usage{
basis_list_cols(
  cols,
  x,
  order_map,
  include_zero_order,
  include_lower_order = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cols}{Index or indices (as \code{numeric}) of covariates (columns) of
interest in the data matrix \code{x} for which basis functions ought to be
generated. Note that basis functions for interactions of these columns are
computed automatically.}

\item{x}{A \code{matrix} containing observations in the rows and covariates
in the columns. Basis functions are computed for these covariates.}

\item{order_map}{An integer vector of length ncol(x) specifying the desired smoothness of the function in each covariate.
 k = 0 is no smoothness (indicator basis), k = 1 is first order smoothness, and so on.
For an additive model, the component function for each covariate will have the degree of smoothness as specified by order_map.
For non-additive components (tensor products of single variate basis functions),
the univariate basis functions in each tensor product have smoothness degree as specified by order_map.}

\item{include_zero_order}{A boolean variable. If true the zero order basis functions are included for each covariate, in addition to the smooth basis functions specified by order_map.
This allows the algorithm to data-adaptively choose the smoothness.}

\item{include_lower_order}{A boolean variable. Similar to include_zero_order, except inclues all basis functions of lower smoothness degrees than specified via order_map.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing the basis functions generated from a set of
 input columns.
}
\description{
Build a list of basis functions from a set of columns
