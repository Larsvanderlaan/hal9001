## What's `hal9001`?

`hal9001` is an R package providing an implementation of the scalable _highly
adaptive lasso_ (HAL), a nonparametric regression estimator that applies
L1-regularized regression (i.e., the lasso) to a design matrix composed of
indicator functions corresponding to a set of covariates and interactions
thereof. Recent theoretical results show that HAL is endowed with several
important optimality properties, making it well-suited for the estimation of
highly complex functional forms while attaining fast convergence rates
($n^(1/4)$ and better) when used in the estimation of nuisance functions. HAL
has been quite successfully used in the construction of estimators at the
intersection of semiparametric theory and nonparametric causal inference (e.g.,
the construction of efficient one-step or targeted minimum loss estimators).

For detailed discussions of the highly adaptive lasso estimator, consider
consulting @benkeser2016hal, @vdl2017generally, and @vdl2017finite, among other
recent works.

## Installation

<!--
For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("hal9001")
```
-->

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `hal9001` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/hal9001", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

## Example

This minimal example shows how to use `hal9001` to obtain predictions based on
the Highly Adaptive Lasso. For details on the properties of the estimator, the
interested reader is referred to @benkeser2016hal and @vdl2017generally.

```{r example}
# load the hal9001 package
library(hal9001)

# simulate data
set.seed(385971)
n <- 100
p <- 3
x <- xmat <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)
y <- x[, 1] * sin(x[, 2]) + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.2)

# fit the HAL regression
hal_fit <- fit_hal(X = x, Y = y)
hal_fit$times

# training sample prediction
preds <- predict(hal_fit, new_data = x)
mean(hal_mse <- (preds - y)^2)
```
