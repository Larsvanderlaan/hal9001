> A faster Highly Adaptive LASSO estimator

**Authors:** [Jeremy Coyle](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle) and [Nima Hejazi](http://nimahejazi.org)

Description
-----------

`lassi` is an R package providing utilities for performing a specialized form of penalized regression (via application of the LASSO) as part of the Highly Adaptive LASSO (HAL), a nonparametric regression estimator with theoretical properties whose optimality has only recently been discovered. Due to the computationally intensive nature of the HAL algorithm, core routines are written in C++ and made available in R via the [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/) framework.

**This project is still in its infancy. Accordingly, it will be regularly updated, possibly with breaking changes. Use at your own risk.**
